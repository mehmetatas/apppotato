# About Broccoli Apps

## Software that respects your time

Most apps want more of your attention. More notifications. More badges. More reasons to check back. We think that's backwards.

Broccoli Apps builds simple tools that do their job and get out of your way. No streaks to maintain. No guilt trips for skipping a day. No dark patterns designed to keep you scrolling.

## Our philosophy

**Do less, better.** Our apps focus on one thing and do it well. No feature bloat, no upsells, no "premium tiers" that lock away basic functionality.

**Respect your time.** We won't send push notifications urging you to come back. We won't show red badges shaming you for overdue tasks. If you don't open our app for a month, that's fine. It'll be there when you need it.

**No tricks.** No addictive mechanics. No gamification. No social comparison features. Just useful tools that help you get things done — or not. It's up to you.

## Why "Broccoli"?

Because it's good for you, but nobody's forcing you to eat it.

If you find our apps useful and want to support development, there's a tip jar in each app. No pressure — the apps are free and will stay that way.
