      <h1>About Broccoli Apps</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Software that respects your time</h2>
        <p>
          Most apps want more of your attention. More notifications. More badges. More reasons to check back. We think
          that's backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Broccoli Apps builds simple tools that do their job and get out of your way. No streaks to maintain. No guilt
          trips for skipping a day. No dark patterns designed to keep you scrolling.

        <h2>Our philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Do less, better.</strong> Our apps focus on one thing and do it well. No feature bloat, no upsells, no
          "premium tiers" that lock away basic functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Respect your time.</strong> We won't send push notifications urging you to come back. We won't show
          red badges shaming you for overdue tasks. If you don't open our app for a month, that's fine. It'll be there
          when you need it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>No tricks.</strong> No addictive mechanics. No gamification. No social comparison features. Just
          useful tools that help you get things done — or not. It's up to you.
        </p>

        <h2>Why "Broccoli"?</h2>
        <p>Because it's good for you, but nobody's forcing you to eat it.</p>

        <p>Broccoli Apps is built by one person in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>
          If you find our apps useful and want to support development, there's a tip jar in each app. No pressure — the
          apps are free and will stay that way.
